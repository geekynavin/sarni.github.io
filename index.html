<p>
    Sarni is located in a part of the Gondwana tract after the Gond tribe, who chiefly inhabited this area and practised shifting cultivation.

<br>
In the fourteenth and fifteenth century, this area of Gonds was infiltrated by Rajputs and who, by the time of Mughals, had succeeded in reclaiming several parts of the Narmada valley for agriculture. The Gonds were pushed to higher plateaus and slopes to continue hunting and their shifting cultivation. This area saw unrest due to the tension between the Marathas and the Mughals during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. During the year 1818, the area saw the advent of British rule.</p>
